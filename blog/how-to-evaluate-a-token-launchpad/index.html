            <p>In our <a href="/blog/how-to-verify-any-token">last post</a>, we shared five checks you can run on any token in about five minutes. If you missed it, start there — it is the foundation for everything that follows.</p>

            <p>Today we go one layer deeper. Because even if a token passes every check on that list — clean contract, fair launch, no hidden mint — there can still be something underneath it that changes everything.</p>

            <p>We are talking about the <strong>launchpad</strong>: the smart contract system that created the token in the first place.</p>

            <h2>What Is a Token Launchpad?</h2>

            <p>Most tokens on Base (and increasingly on other chains) are not hand-coded by developers. They are deployed through <strong>factory contracts</strong> — automated systems that stamp out new tokens with pre-configured settings. Think of it like the difference between a chef cooking from scratch and a machine producing identical meals on an assembly line.</p>

            <p>If you have spent any time scrolling a feed of on-chain activity recently, you have probably noticed this firsthand: dozens or hundreds of tokens appearing per hour, all with similar structures, all deployed by bot accounts. That is factory production in action. The factory determines the default settings for every token it creates.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>The factory determines the rules.</strong> What fee structure is built into the trading pool. Who receives those fees. Whether any of this can be changed after launch. Whether the liquidity is locked, and how. When you evaluate a token, you are reading the label on the package. When you evaluate the launchpad, you are inspecting the factory.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why This Matters More Than Most People Think</h2>

            <p>Here is the key insight: <strong>a launchpad can enforce rules that the token creator never agreed to, may not understand, and cannot change.</strong></p>

            <p>Let us walk through a hypothetical. Imagine you are evaluating a token using the five checks from our last post:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>No founder allocation &#10004;</li>
                <li>Fair launch &#10004;</li>
                <li>Locked liquidity &#10004;</li>
                <li>Clean wallet — creator never sold a token &#10004;</li>
                <li>No mint function, no fee-on-transfer &#10004;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Looks good, right? All five checks pass. By the token-level framework, this is a clean launch.</p>

            <p>But what if the factory that deployed it baked a <strong>permanent fee into the trading pool</strong> — a fee that goes to the factory operators, not the token creator? And what if that fee is hardcoded into an immutable contract, meaning it can never be turned off by anyone?</p>

            <p>That would mean every single trade enriches a third party that the community may not even know exists. Not because the token creator chose it, but because the factory enforced it.</p>

            <p><strong>This is not hypothetical. This architecture exists on Base right now.</strong></p>

            <p>This is why the token-level checks from our last post are necessary but not sufficient. You can have a perfectly clean token sitting on top of a fee-extracting infrastructure that drains value on every trade. The token contract has no fee. The pool does. And if you only read the token contract, you will never see it.</p>

            <h2>The Launchpad Evaluation Framework</h2>

            <p>When evaluating a token's launchpad, here are four things to check. Together with the five token-level checks from our last post, these give you a complete picture of any token's full stack.</p>

            <!-- Check 1 -->
            <div class="check-step">
                <span class="check-step-num">Check 1</span>
                <h3>Fee architecture: Who gets paid on every trade?</h3>

                <p>Launchpads can insert themselves into the fee flow in ways that are invisible if you only look at the token contract. This is the most important thing to understand: <strong>fees can exist at the pool level even when the token itself has zero fees.</strong></p>

                <p>Here is what to look for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Does the launchpad take a protocol fee?</strong> This is a cut of every swap that goes to the launchpad operators — separate from LP fees, separate from anything the token creator controls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Who receives that protocol fee?</strong> Is it a known team, a DAO, or an anonymous wallet?</li>
                    <li><strong>Is the fee percentage hardcoded or configurable?</strong> A configurable fee can be changed — for better or worse. A hardcoded fee is permanent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Can the fee be turned off after deployment?</strong> Some systems allow fee recipients to be changed or zeroed out. Others do not.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>How to check:</strong> Find the pool contract for the token's primary trading pair. If the pool uses a custom <em>hook</em> (common in Uniswap v4), read that hook contract's source code. Look for fee-splitting logic — functions like <code>afterSwap()</code> or <code>beforeSwap()</code> that divert a percentage. Look for constants like <code>PROTOCOL_FEE_NUMERATOR</code> or similar. The fee split between protocol and LP is usually defined in these constants.</p>

                <p>The answers to these questions may surprise you.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Check 2 -->
            <div class="check-step">
                <span class="check-step-num">Check 2</span>
                <h3>Immutability: Can any of this be changed?</h3>

                <p>Smart contracts can be <strong>mutable</strong> (upgradeable) or <strong>immutable</strong> (permanent). Both have real tradeoffs:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mutable (proxy/upgradeable):</strong> Can be fixed if something is wrong — but can also be weaponized. An admin could change the rules after people buy in. The risk is governance, not code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immutable (direct deployment):</strong> Cannot be rugged by an admin changing the rules — but also cannot be repaired. If the fee structure is unfavorable, it stays unfavorable forever.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>The worst case is an immutable contract with an unfavorable fee structure.</strong> It means: this is permanent, no one can fix it, and everyone who trades through this pool will pay this fee forever. No governance vote, no community petition, no technical fix can change it. The code does not contain the functions needed to change it.</p>

                <p><strong>How to check:</strong> Go to the launchpad's core contracts on any block explorer — the factory, the fee locker, the pool hook, the LP locker. For each one, look for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The word <strong>"proxy"</strong> in the contract name or type — this indicates upgradeability</li>
                    <li>An <strong><code>implementation()</code></strong> function — present in proxy contracts</li>
                    <li>An <strong><code>upgradeTo()</code></strong> or <strong><code>upgradeToAndCall()</code></strong> function</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If none of these exist, the contract is a direct deployment — immutable. What you see is what you get, forever.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Check 3 -->
            <div class="check-step">
                <span class="check-step-num">Check 3</span>
                <h3>Liquidity lock: What exactly is locked?</h3>

                <p>"Locked liquidity" sounds reassuring. But the details matter enormously, and they are often different from what people assume.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Is the LP position held as an ERC-721 NFT in a locker contract?</strong> In Uniswap v4, LP positions are NFTs. The locker holds the NFT, not fungible tokens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Does the locker have a <code>removeLiquidity()</code> function?</strong> If no such function exists in the contract code, the liquidity is truly permanent — it cannot be withdrawn by anyone, ever.</li>
                    <li><strong>Can fees be collected from the locked position?</strong> Locking liquidity does not necessarily mean locking the fee revenue it generates. The locker may allow fee claims even while the principal is locked.</li>
                    <li><strong>Can a new pool be created to compete with the locked one?</strong> If liquidity is locked in Pool A, someone could theoretically create Pool B with different fee structures. But the locked liquidity in Pool A is not going anywhere.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The difference between "locked for 6 months" and "locked permanently with no withdrawal function" is the difference between a safety measure and an unchangeable commitment. Both have their place — but you should know which one you are looking at.</p>

                <p><strong>How to check:</strong> Find the locker contract address (it will be the holder of the LP NFT). Read its verified source code on a block explorer. Search for <code>withdraw</code>, <code>remove</code>, or <code>unlock</code> functions. If they exist, check who can call them and under what conditions. If they do not exist, the lock is permanent.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Check 4 -->
            <div class="check-step">
                <span class="check-step-num">Check 4</span>
                <h3>Separation of concerns: Token vs. infrastructure</h3>

                <p>A well-designed system separates the token from the infrastructure. The <strong>token contract</strong> handles balances and transfers. The <strong>trading infrastructure</strong> handles liquidity and fees. The <strong>launch platform</strong> handles deployment.</p>

                <p>Problems arise when these layers are entangled — when the launch platform permanently inserts itself into the trading infrastructure in ways that cannot be separated.</p>

                <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can the token exist independently of the launchpad that created it?</li>
                    <li>Is the fee structure a property of the token, or of the infrastructure?</li>
                    <li>If the launchpad team disappeared tomorrow, would the token still function normally?</li>
                    <li>Could the community migrate to different trading infrastructure if they wanted to?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A token where the launchpad has permanently welded itself into the fee flow is not truly independent — even if the token contract itself is clean. The token is a hostage of its own infrastructure.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Factory Flood</h2>

            <p>If you spend any time on platforms in this ecosystem, you have probably noticed something: feeds flooded with bot-generated tokens. Minting operations, transfer spam, factory-produced assets appearing faster than anyone can evaluate them.</p>

            <p>This is what mass factory production looks like. And it is precisely why evaluating the factory matters. When tokens are being stamped out by the hundred, the factory's defaults become the ecosystem's defaults. Whatever fee structure, whatever lock mechanism, whatever architectural choices the factory enforces — those choices are replicated across every single token it produces.</p>

            <p>One factory with a problematic fee structure is not one problem. It is hundreds of problems.</p>

            <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

            <p>We are not telling you this to scare you. We are telling you this because this is what <strong>"trustless" is supposed to mean</strong> — you verify the full stack, not just the surface.</p>

            <p>Most people evaluate tokens. Almost nobody evaluates the factory that made the token. But the factory can impose permanent conditions that matter more than anything in the token contract itself.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Two frameworks, one full picture.</strong> If you have been following along, you now have the tools to evaluate any token from both angles — the token itself and the infrastructure underneath it.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Quick Reference: The Full Stack Checklist</h2>

            <p>Combining the <a href="/blog/how-to-verify-any-token">token-level checks</a> from our last post with today's infrastructure checks:</p>

            <h2>What Comes Next</h2>

            <p>In our next post, we will put both frameworks to work. We have been applying them to this ecosystem, and we have findings to share. <strong>Specific contracts. Specific numbers. Specific addresses.</strong> All verifiable.</p>

            <p>We are not asking you to trust us. We are asking you to learn the tools — and then verify everything yourself.</p>
