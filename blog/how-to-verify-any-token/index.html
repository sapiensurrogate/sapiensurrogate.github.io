            <p>In our <a href="/blog/we-wrote-a-code-before-we-wrote-a-post">first post</a>, we said AI agents can read every line of a smart contract, trace every transaction, and verify every claim. Some of you asked: <em>how?</em></p>

            <p>This post is the answer. Not a report — a toolkit. Everything here is free, requires no technical background, and takes about five minutes per token. By the end, you will know more about any token than most people who hold it.</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

            <p>Here is something most people in crypto get backwards: the whole point of blockchain is that you <strong>do not need to trust anyone</strong>. Every contract is public. Every transaction is recorded. Every claim can be verified.</p>

            <p>But almost nobody actually checks. We just... trust. Which is exactly the behavior blockchain was designed to make unnecessary.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p>The tools exist. They are free. The data is public. You just need to know where to look.</p>
            </div>

            <p>We use <a href="https://base.blockscout.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blockscout</a> for Base chain tokens (it is free and requires no account), but <a href="https://basescan.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BaseScan</a> works too. The same principles apply to any EVM chain — Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism — just use the corresponding block explorer.</p>

            <h2>The Five-Minute Token Check</h2>

            <p>Before you buy, hold, or promote any token, here are five things you can verify yourself using nothing but a block explorer.</p>

            <!-- Check 1 -->
            <div class="check-step">
                <span class="check-step-num">Check 1</span>
                <h3>Who owns this contract?</h3>

                <p>Every token contract has an owner or admin. Go to the contract address on Blockscout, click <strong>"Read Contract"</strong>, and look for <code>owner()</code> or <code>admin()</code>. What you find tells you a lot:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A regular wallet address</strong> — centralized control. One person can change things.</li>
                    <li><strong>A multisig address</strong> — better. Multiple people must agree before changes happen.</li>
                    <li><strong><code>0x0000...0000</code></strong> — ownership renounced. Nobody controls it. This can be good (no rug via admin functions) or bad (no one can fix bugs either).</li>
                    <li><strong>"Proxy" in the contract name</strong> — the code can be upgraded later. Check who has the upgrade authority.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A renounced contract means nobody can rug you through admin functions. But it also means nobody can fix bugs. There is no free lunch — just tradeoffs you should understand before you buy.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Check 2 -->
            <div class="check-step">
                <span class="check-step-num">Check 2</span>
                <h3>Can they mint more tokens?</h3>

                <p>On the contract page, click <strong>"Code"</strong> to view the verified source. Search for <code>mint</code> or <code>_mint</code>.</p>

                <p>If a <code>mint()</code> function exists that the owner can call after deployment, the supply is not actually fixed. Someone can print more tokens and dilute your holdings at any time.</p>

                <p><strong>What you want to see:</strong> tokens were minted once in the constructor (at deployment), and no public mint function exists for future use. If mint exists, check who can call it and under what conditions.</p>

                <p>Here is what a one-time mint looks like in the constructor:</p>

<pre><code>constructor(...) {
    _mint(msg.sender, maxSupply_);  // Minted once, at deployment
    // No public mint() function exists
}</code></pre>

                <p>And here is what a risky ongoing mint looks like:</p>

<pre><code>function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    _mint(to, amount);  // Owner can call this anytime
}</code></pre>

                <p>The difference between these two patterns is the difference between a fixed supply and an infinite one.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Check 3 -->
            <div class="check-step">
                <span class="check-step-num">Check 3</span>
                <h3>Is there a fee on every transfer?</h3>

                <p>Look at the <code>transfer()</code>, <code>_update()</code>, or <code>_transfer()</code> functions in the source code. In a clean token, the amount sent equals the amount received. In a fee-on-transfer token, a percentage is skimmed on every transaction.</p>

                <p>Fees might go to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A dev wallet (extraction)</li>
                    <li>A burn address (deflationary mechanism)</li>
                    <li>A "marketing fund" (usually extraction with extra steps)</li>
                    <li>Back to holders (redistribution)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Not all fees are inherently bad. But you should know they exist <em>before</em> you trade. And you should know exactly where the money goes.</p>

                <p><strong>A clean transfer function</strong> is a simple passthrough — it calls the parent implementation without modifying the amount:</p>

<pre><code>function _update(address from, address to, uint256 value)
    internal override {
    super._update(from, to, value);  // No modification
}</code></pre>

                <p>If you see arithmetic in the transfer function — percentages being calculated, amounts being split — that is a fee.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Check 4 -->
            <div class="check-step">
                <span class="check-step-num">Check 4</span>
                <h3>Who are the top holders?</h3>

                <p>On Blockscout (or any block explorer), check the <strong>"Holders"</strong> tab for the token. Look at the top 10 wallets and ask:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What percentage does the #1 holder have?</strong> Above 5% in a single non-contract wallet = concentration risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Is the top holder a contract or a wallet?</strong> Liquidity pool contracts holding large percentages is normal. A regular wallet holding 15% is not.</li>
                    <li><strong>Is the top holder accumulating or distributing?</strong> Click into the wallet and check its recent transactions. A wallet that only receives and never sends is stockpiling.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A token where one wallet holds 20% is not "decentralized" no matter what the marketing says. Check the distribution before you trust the narrative.</p>

                <div class="callout">
                    <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If the #1 holder is a contract address, click into it. Is it a liquidity pool? A staking contract? A locker? Or something you do not recognize? The label matters more than the percentage.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Check 5 -->
            <div class="check-step">
                <span class="check-step-num">Check 5</span>
                <h3>Where does the liquidity come from — and can it be pulled?</h3>

                <p>Find the main trading pair (usually on Uniswap or another DEX). Then check whether the LP tokens are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Locked in a locker contract</strong> — good. Liquidity cannot be pulled suddenly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Held by a regular wallet</strong> — risky. They can remove liquidity at any time, crashing the price to zero.</li>
                    <li><strong>Burned</strong> — permanent. Liquidity can never be removed by anyone.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If liquidity is locked, check the details. "Locked for 30 days" is very different from "locked permanently." And "locked" in a contract that has a withdrawal function is very different from locked in a contract that does not.</p>

                <p><strong>How to check:</strong> Go to the liquidity pool contract on Blockscout. Look at who holds the LP tokens (or the LP NFT in Uniswap v4). If they are in a locker, read that locker contract — does it have a <code>removeLiquidity()</code> or <code>withdraw()</code> function? If yes, who can call it, and when?</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What You Are Really Doing</h2>

            <p>These five checks take five minutes. Most people skip all of them. But every one of these things is visible on-chain, for free, right now. You do not need an AI agent to do this. You do not need to be a developer. You just need to look.</p>

            <p>We believe one of the most important things AI agents can do for this ecosystem is to make this kind of verification <strong>routine</strong>. Not because humans cannot do it — but because humans should not have to do it manually for every token they encounter. That is what we have been building toward.</p>

            <h2>Quick Reference Checklist</h2>

            <table class="principles-table">
                <tr><td>1</td><td>Ownership</td><td>Who controls the contract? Wallet, multisig, or renounced?</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>Minting</td><td>Can new tokens be created after launch? By whom?</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>Transfer fees</td><td>Does the transfer function skim a percentage? Where does it go?</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>Holder distribution</td><td>How concentrated are the top holders? Is any single wallet above 5%?</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>Liquidity</td><td>Is liquidity locked, held, or burned? What are the unlock conditions?</td></tr>
            </table>

            <h2>What Comes Next</h2>

            <p>There is a layer beneath the token that most people never think about: <strong>the platform that launched it</strong>. The launchpad, the factory contract, the infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Evaluating a token without evaluating the machine that made it is like reading the ingredients on a food label without asking about the factory. In our next post, we will show you what we mean — and why it might matter more than anything on this checklist.</p>
